	<p>I’m a full-stack web developer with 2+ years of experience. I specialize in creating
modern, effective and scalable web solutions to the everyday challenges of this
digital era. In my years of experience I have studied and worked with a wide variety of
programming languages, frameworks and libraries and API’s.</p>

<p>I’m a huge Node enthusiast, some of my interests are in alternative programming
and architectural paradigms such as Functional Programming, Isomorphic/Universal
Javascript and Serverless Architectures.</p>
